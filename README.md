## Upcoming

### PERI Exchange

Users will be able to converting one Pynth to another without worrying about how deep the liquidity nor slippage. Users will also be able to be benefited by taking short or long positions of Pynths with 20x leverage.  
Prices will be committed on chain by a trusted oracle. Moving to a decentralised oracle will be phased in with the first phase completed for all forex prices using [Chainlink](https://feeds.chain.link/).
